# Operator

A Kubernetes operator for automating the management and operation of applications on Kubernetes.

## Description

This Kubernetes operator extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure and manage Inference Gateway instances within a Kubernetes cluster. It's specifically designed to automate the deployment and management of AI inference gateways that connect with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which may live on remote infrastructure. In its first stage, the operator focuses on controlling in-cluster resources such as deployments, services, and configuration for the gateway components.

The operator handles various aspects of gateway management including authentication configuration, provider service integration, and network endpoint exposure. Future development will extend its capabilities to create and manage the lifecycle of remote MCP servers that the gateway connects to, providing a unified control plane for both the gateway infrastructure and its associated AI workloads.

The operator pattern allows you to codify operational knowledge and workflows that would typically require human operator intervention. This implementation follows best practices for cloud-native applications, including high availability, scalability, and seamless upgrades.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.23.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
task install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
> privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

> **NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
task uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
task undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
task build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
   can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
